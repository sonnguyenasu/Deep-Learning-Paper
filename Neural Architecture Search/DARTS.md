## Introduction
This paper is the first paper that address the issue of discrete search in NAS algorithms. In other words, since NAS algorithms often treat the problems of architecture search as finding computational graphs with discrete set of operations, they are not differentiable, and not capable of gradient optimization methods. There are some works on continuous search space, but they have constraint on hyper-parameters and available search options. DARTS, combining the strength of both world, helps searching Architecture of the network much faster and efficient while keeping the search space flexibility it needs to not decrease performance.
