# Deep-Learning-Paper

This is inspired by the work of multiple people on the internet (including but not limited to Yannick Klitcher and Patrick Liu, you guys can check their amazing work)
To be short, it is my resolution for 2021 to keeps reading and summarizing significant paper in Machine Learning, especially Computer Vision. I will also try to reimplement some of the interesting paper.
